Being a regular polyhedron means that the faces are congruent (identical in shape and size) regular polygons (all angles congruent and all edges congruent), and the same number of faces meet at each vertex. There are only five such polyhedra.    Polyhedron      In geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons) is a three-dimensional shape with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices."},{"location":"resources/links/","title":"Links","text":""},{"location":"resources/links/#dymaxion","title":"dymaxion","text":"<ul> <li>https://github.com/alanbernstein/dymaxion</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/links/#dymax","title":"dymax","text":"<ul> <li>https://pypi.org/project/dymax/</li> <li>https://github.com/Teque5/pydymax</li> </ul>"},{"location":"resources/links/#icosphere","title":"icosphere","text":"<ul> <li>https://pypi.org/project/icosphere/</li> <li> <p>https://github.com/vedranaa/icosphere</p> </li> <li> <p>https://github.com/brdo/icosahedron/blob/master/icosahedron.py</p> </li> <li> <p>https://github.com/stephane-caron/pypoman/</p> </li> <li> <p>https://github.com/spacetelescope/spherical_geometry</p> </li> <li> <p>http://blog.andreaskahler.com/2009/06/creating-icosphere-mesh-in-code.html</p> </li> <li>https://sinestesia.co/blog/tutorials/python-icospheres/</li> </ul>"}]}
